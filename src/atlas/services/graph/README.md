# `services.graph`

Neighborhood-graph assembly — the domain core of arXiv Atlas.

```
graph/
  build.py   — build_graph: assembly logic (single-provider traversal, dedupe,
               cached); Provider + resolve_provider
  model.py   — the Pydantic Graph / Node / Edge / Seed / Counts
  budget.py  — adaptive landmark-budget serving: predict it from the seed (the
               trained model) or measure it from a pool in hand (the density rule)
  bands.py   — adaptive latest-band serving: where a seed's Latest bands start
```

`__init__.py` re-exports `build_graph`, `Provider`, `resolve_provider`, and the
models, so callers use `graph.build_graph(...)` / `graph.Provider` without
reaching into the submodules.

## Why it exists

Everything the user sees on screen — the force-directed graph of papers around a
seed — is the output of one function, `build_graph()`. `routes/graph.py`'s
`/api/graph` endpoint is a thin HTTP wrapper over it.

Given a **seed paper** and a **provider**, it produces a Connected-Papers-style
graph: the seed at the center, surrounded by three kinds of neighbor —
references, landmark citations, and latest (recent-frontier) citations.

## One provider per graph (v5.0.0)

A graph is built from **exactly one** academic-data backend, chosen by the caller
(the header dropdown → `provider` query arg → `build_graph(provider=…)`):

- **`"s2"`** (Semantic Scholar) — seed / references / citations all via S2. Its
  live citation endpoint is newest-first with no citation sort, so landmark
  citers are recency-biased for a heavily-cited seed. `_traverse_s2` therefore
  prefers the **offline S2 citations corpus** (`s2.corpus.citation_relations`,
  citation-sorted across all history) when it's ingested and can resolve the
  seed, falling back to the recency-biased live path otherwise. Which one served
  a given build is recorded on `Graph.citation_source` (`"corpus"`/`"live"`) —
  surfaced to the UI's Field-Landmarks note.
- **`"openalex"`** — seed / references / citations all via OpenAlex, whose
  server-sorted `cites:` / `cited_by:` queries return the most-cited citers and
  references directly. Tradeoff: a famous published paper resolves to its
  lower-cited arXiv-preprint record.

This replaced the v4.x **hybrid** (S2 seed/refs/similar + OpenAlex citations,
merged with `max` counts and cross-source id dedup). A single provider means one
citation-count scale (node sizes are finally comparable across relations) and no
cross-source identity glue. The **Similar relation was retired** from the build
entirely (the S2 recommendations client lives on only for the researcher's
`expand_node`). `provider` defaults to `config.graph.default_provider` when
omitted; `resolve_provider(raw)` is the shared validator (unknown → default) used
by both the graph and search routes.

## The shape it builds

```
        references (papers the seed cites — its ancestors)
              ▲
              │  edge: seed ──▶ ancestor        (the seed is the citer)
              │
   ┌──────────┴──────────┐
   │        SEED         │
   └──────────┬──────────┘
              │
              │  edge: descendant ──▶ seed       (the descendant is the citer)
              ▼
        citations (papers that cite the seed — its descendants:
                   landmark "citation" + recent-frontier "latest")
```

`build_graph()` returns a typed **Pydantic `Graph`** (not a bare dict), with:
- **`seed`** (`Seed`) — `{arxiv_id, id, title}`, a compact summary for the header.
- **`nodes`** (`list[Node]`) — deduped papers, each the normalized node fields
  plus a `rels` list (which relations surfaced it) and an `is_seed` flag.
- **`edges`** (`list[Edge]`) — `{source, target, type, influential, rank}`;
  `type` is `reference | citation | latest` from the build (the `similar` literal
  survives on the model for researcher-discovered nodes, but the seed build never
  emits it); `influential` is S2's highly-influential flag (always `None` under
  OpenAlex); `rank` is the edge's 0-based position within its relation's order.
- **`counts`** (`Counts`) — post-dedupe edge counts per relation plus the final
  deduped node count. `counts.similar` is always `0` (kept for schema stability).
- **`citation_source`** (`"corpus"` / `"live"` / `None`) — for an s2 graph, where
  the citer relations came from (the offline corpus vs. the recency-biased live
  endpoint); `None` for OpenAlex (server-sorted, so N/A) and pre-corpus cached
  snapshots. Drives the frontend's Field-Landmarks provider note.

The models live in `model.py`, beside `build.py`'s `build_graph`. Callers that
need JSON serialize with `graph.model_dump()` — the routes hand it to `jsonify`.
The model is also what goes in and out of the cache (stored as JSON, re-validated
on read), so the shape can't silently drift — at the cost of a validate on each
cache hit, a deliberate trade.

## How it works, step by step

1. **Blank-guard, resolve provider, cache.** Empty seed → `None`. `provider`
   defaults to `config.graph.default_provider`. The cache is keyed by
   **`graph:<provider>:<seed_ref>`** — an S2 graph and an OpenAlex graph for the
   same paper are separate snapshots and must never collide. The *whole assembled
   snapshot* is cached (TTL `config.graph.cache_ttl`), so re-opening a paper is
   free. The key uses the *raw* seed reference — an arXiv id and the provider node
   id it resolves to are separate entry points on purpose, to avoid a resolution
   round-trip just to normalize the key.

2. **Resolve the seed + traverse, per provider.** `build_graph` dispatches to
   `_traverse_s2` or `_traverse_openalex`, each returning the same payload:
   `(seed_node, references, landmark_citers, latest_citers, citation_source)`, or
   `None` when the provider has no paper for the reference.
   - **S2**: an arXiv-shaped ref is looked up as `ARXIV:<id>` (S2's external-id
     syntax); a raw S2 paperId passes through untouched. `arxiv.looks_arxiv()`
     tells them apart with `ID_RE.fullmatch`. References via `s2.references`,
     citers via `s2.corpus.citation_relations` when the offline corpus can serve
     the seed, else the live `s2.citation_relations` fallback.
   - **OpenAlex**: `openalex.resolve_seed_work` accepts an arXiv id or a
     `DOI:`/`ARXIV:`/`W…` node id; references via `openalex.references`
     (`cited_by:`), citers via `openalex.citation_relations` (`cites:`), with the
     adaptive `band_start` wired in.

   This is the mechanism that lets you **re-seed on any node**, including a
   journal paper with no arXiv id, so exploration never dead-ends.

3. **Adaptive budgets** (shared by both providers). The **landmark budget adapts
   to the seed** when `config.graph.adaptive_cite_limit` is on — by one of two
   routes to the same criterion, chosen by *what kind of pool the path holds*:

   - **Computed** — `budget.computed_cite_limit` runs the **STOP** rule over the
     real citer years and returns a count: the length of the citation-ranked
     prefix to ship. Used by every **whole-history** pool, injected as a
     `landmark_budget` callable: the **offline corpus** (the rule runs between
     its query's two phases, on the narrow ranking), **OpenAlex** (the rule is
     prefix-local, so its one server-sorted 200-row page holds everything the
     rule reads — `openalex._budgeted_landmarks`), and a **complete live S2
     pool** (a citer list that ends before the offset ceiling — most seeds —
     which then ships the whole corpus shape, tau-banded Latest included:
     `s2.traversal._complete_pool_relations`).
   - **Selected** — `budget.select_landmarks` walks the pool's real ranking and
     admits up to `PER_YEAR_CAP` citers **per year**, skipping years already full
     (the **SKIP** rule). Used by the live S2 fallback's **truncated** pools,
     injected as its `landmark_select` callable. A truncated pool is a recency
     sliver with no all-history ranking, and a count can only ever keep a
     **prefix** — which there is all one era (DQN's reachable pool starts 2019,
     not 2013).

   A third route — **Predicted**, the offline-trained `cite_budget` model
   (`src/ml_pipelines/cite_budget/model.joblib`) — served OpenAlex until
   v5.13.0, on the premise that a remote server-sorted query needs its `limit`
   *before* any citer is in hand. The premise fell to the STOP rule's
   prefix-locality (it never reads past the first year to overflow, and the
   sort puts that prefix on page one), so OpenAlex now computes exactly too;
   `budget.predicted_budget` and the artifact remain for the `ml_pipelines`.
   See `docs/predict-vs-compute.md`'s epilogue.

     The difference between the two rules is one word — what happens when a citer
     lands on a year that's already full:

     ```
     ranked citer years:  2020  2020  2020  2019  2018  2020  2017   (cap = 2)

     STOP   third 2020 overflows  -> quit the walk       => 2, both in 2020
     SKIP   third 2020 is skipped -> carry on walking    => 5, spanning 2017-2020
     ```

     Measured on truncated DQN: STOP ships 29, all 2019–2023, with nothing from
     2024–2025 — an 18-month hole before the Latest frontier. SKIP ships 84,
     twelve in each of 2019–2025, and closes it. Both honour the same "no year
     over the cap" invariant; which is honest depends on the pool — SKIP keeps a
     truncated sliver's sparse years, while on a whole-history ranking the STOP
     prefix *is* the landmark band and tau-banded Latest closes the gap instead.
     STOP is also the retired model's training **label** (a regression label has
     to be a scalar) — see
     [`docs/landmark-vocabulary.md`](../../../../docs/landmark-vocabulary.md).

     Undated citers are **dropped**, not banded: a landmark is the claim
     "top-cited citer of this seed *in year Y*", which a paper with no year can't
     make — and it has no place on a time axis either. Giving them a bucket (an
     earlier cut did) ships a guaranteed `PER_YEAR_CAP` of what are mostly
     PDF-extraction stubs, all on one x, drawing a vertical bar through the seed.

   See `budget.py`'s module docstring and `src/ml_pipelines/cite_budget/README.md`.
   Both selectors carry a **config-free core** (`select_up_to_cap_per_year`,
   `predicted_budget`) so pipelines can run the exact serving rule without the local
   `config.json` — `live_pool_validation` measures both over simulated truncated
   pools.

   The **latest bands adapt** too (`config.graph.adaptive_latest_band`): `bands.py`
   places the band start at the **density tail edge** of the landmark cluster (a
   second offline model, `src/ml_pipelines/latest_gap/model.joblib`), closing the
   gap for an old seed and keeping a tight frontier for a young one. `build.py`
   injects `bands.earliest_band_year` as the OpenAlex `band_start` callable so
   `integrations` stays below `services` in the import order (its config-free
   core is `bands.band_start_rule`, shared with the validation pipeline). See
   `src/ml_pipelines/latest_gap/README.md`.

4. **Dedupe + relation accumulation.** The `add_neighbor()` closure merges
   neighbors into one node table — keyed by raw id, with identity resolved through
   the **arXiv id** whenever a sighting has one. Within a single provider this
   still earns its keep: a paper that's both a reference *and* a citer (a mutual
   citation) merges into one node carrying both rels, and OpenAlex **duplicate
   works** for one paper (two works sharing an arXiv id) collapse into one node.
   First sighting wins the slot; later ones append their tag to `rels` and fill
   fields via `_upgrade_node` (max `citation_count`, fill-if-None for summary/date
   fields). `add_neighbor` returns the **canonical id** the edge loops must use —
   for a merged paper it differs from the sighting's own id.

   A dedupe consequence for edges: two sightings can collapse onto one endpoint,
   so `add_edge()` skips self-loops and already-drawn `(source, target, type)`
   triples, and each relation's `rank` counter only advances on an edge actually
   drawn — ranks stay compact for the frontend's reveal sliders.

5. **Build typed edges — direction is load-bearing.** An edge always points from
   the citing paper to the cited one:
   - **reference** → `seed → ancestor` (the seed cites it), carries `influential`.
   - **citation** (landmark) and **latest** (recent-frontier) → `descendant →
     seed` (it cites the seed) — *opposite* direction — carry `influential`. Both
     are citers, split by recency into two relations (see the provider READMEs).

   Getting a direction backwards would silently invert the citation arrows in the
   UI, which is why this is the most-commented part of the code.

6. **Assemble + cache.** Package the `Graph` and cache its `model_dump`. Note
   `counts.nodes < references + citations` whenever dedup merged a paper that
   appeared in multiple relations.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **The whole snapshot is cached, not the individual calls.** One cache entry per
  `(provider, seed)`, TTL'd, rather than caching each traversal separately.
- **`arxiv.looks_arxiv` uses `fullmatch`, not `search`.** (Shared with the S2
  seed lookup — it lives in `integrations.arxiv`.) We only treat a reference as an
  arXiv id when it is *entirely* one; a paperId that happens to contain id-shaped
  digits must fall through to the paperId path. (`routes/graph.py` uses
  `arxiv.ID_RE.search` instead — it's pulling an id out of pasted free text.)
- **Neighbors aren't re-hydrated.** The traversal responses carry enough for
  display, so `build_graph` never does a follow-up batch fetch. Clicking a node
  for its full detail panel is a *separate* `get_paper` call in the route (which
  stays on S2 in this phase, for both providers — OpenAlex nodes carry
  S2-resolvable ids so this works).

## Who uses it

- **`routes/graph.py`** — `GET /api/graph?seed=…&provider=…&refresh=…` calls
  `build_graph` and returns `graph.model_dump()` as JSON, catching `s2.S2Error`
  *and* `openalex.OpenAlexError` and turning either into an HTTP 502 (named for
  the active provider). The `refresh` param maps straight to the kwarg.
- **`routes/search.py`** — imports `resolve_provider` to scope the local cache
  search to the selected provider's snapshots.

## Testing

`test_graph.py` monkeypatches each provider's traversal calls with canned node
dicts and uses the real SQLite cache on the per-test temp DB. It asserts: the S2
and OpenAlex build shapes (seed + references + landmark + latest, correct edge
directions and counts, `similar` always 0); that a mutual-citation paper and an
OpenAlex duplicate-work merge into one node; that a citer that *is* the seed never
self-loops; that the cache is **keyed by provider** (S2 and OpenAlex snapshots
don't collide, and each is served from its own entry); `model_dump()` round-trips
through `Graph.model_validate`; refresh bypasses the cache; `resolve_provider`
validates/defaults; an unknown or blank seed returns `None`; and the adapted
budget is what *both* providers' citation traversals receive.

It also pins **which budget route each path gets** — since v5.11.0, **OpenAlex is
the only one predicting**. It receives the model's count because its query is
remote and server-sorted, so nothing is in hand at the moment of decision. The
corpus receives `budget.computed_cite_limit` (measure the pool you already
fetched), the live fallback `budget.select_landmarks` (band it, since a prefix of a
truncated pool strands the recent years), and both take the flat `cite_limit` only
as a ceiling.

The adaptive budget's own tests live in **`test_budget.py`** — both routes: the
predicted one (loading the committed model, pinning the worked examples /
fallbacks) and the computed one (the two pure rules and the trim built on them).
The latest-band
serving tests are in **`test_bands.py`**. The training pipelines that produce both
models have their own offline tests under `test/ml_pipelines/`, which pin that
training uses the app's feature *and* label contracts rather than private copies.
